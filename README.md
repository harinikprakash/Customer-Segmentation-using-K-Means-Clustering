# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
Completed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, this project applies K-Means Clustering to segment retail customers based on their purchase history. Built using Python and the Kaggle Customer Segmentation dataset, with preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.


📌 Task Objective:
Create a K-Means Clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history.


📊 Dataset Used:
Kaggle: Customer Segmentation Dataset


🛠️ Technologies & Tools:

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn


✅ Key Features:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Determining optimal clusters (Elbow Method)

Customer segmentation using K-Means

Cluster visualization and interpretation
